      <p class="h3 mb-3">Dr. Dennis Gross Dermatology at Topping Rose House: Treatment Offerings</p>
      <p><strong>Botox®</strong><br>
      Botox® is considered a neuromodulator, meaning it is injected into the muscle to help the muscle relax, resulting in a weaker line or wrinkle. A weaker line or wrinkle will give the patient an overall smoother, more awake and more refreshed look. Dr. Gross is a top injector of Botox across the country and has been expertly injecting neuromodulators for his patients for over 15 years. He believes in a conservative look, providing the patient with beautiful, natural enhancements.</>

      <p><strong>Filler</strong><br>Whether you're interested in addressing facial wrinkles and hollows or you want a non-invasive solution to enhance your lips, dermal fillers can be the answer. Dr. Dennis Gross Dermatology is proud to offer a wide range of dermal fillers and injectables for patients. Dr. Gross is nationally recognized as a platinum injector.</p>

      <p><strong>Bespoke Facials</strong><br>Do you have a special occasion coming up, want to treat yourself to a luxurious spa treatment, or simply want to achieve brighter and more even skin? Dr. Dennis Gross Dermatology offers a wide range of customizable medical facials to give you the skin of your dreams.</p>

      <p><strong>Chemical Peels</strong><br>Interested in a non-invasive solution to brighter, smoother, and more flawless skin? Dr. Dennis Gross Dermatology offers a variety of chemical face peels. Chemical peels safely remove or exfoliate the top layer of dead skin allowing new, more youthful, healthy skin to show through. While the skin typically sheds old, dull dead skin cells every 28 days, this process slows down with prolonged sun exposure and aging. Chemical peels cause this natural cell turnover process to speed up, helping to stimulate the growth of new collagen, or the skin-firming protein that acts like a scaffold for the skin.</p>
