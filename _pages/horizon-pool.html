      <p>The Horizon Pool is a true focal point of the newly re-imagined Keswick Hall.</p>
      <p>Overlooking the lush Full Cry Golf Course with the beautiful mountains in the distance, our 80-foot T-shaped infinity-edge swimming pool is dual level with a 3-foot waterfall cascading over an 8-foot waterfall wall.  Pool Terraces are thoughtfully designed to offer easy access to a variety of amenities including a refreshment bar, towel service, and changing rooms, all surrounded by gardens that provide a private and serene setting.  The two pools will offer distinct heat settings on each level so that swimmers can choose their preference as well as built-in bench seating, wheelchair accessibility and a new ultra-violet light filtering system for clean chemical-free water.</p>
      <p>Special attention has been paid to the design of the in-pool and poolside lighting to create a dramatic evening ambiance, perfect to enjoy a refreshing cocktail as the day draws into night.</p>
