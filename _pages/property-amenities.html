      <p class="small-paragraph">Keswick Hall is the setting for cherished, unforgettable gatherings. From bridal shower getaways, to a gentleman's weekend on the Full Cry golf course, allow us to host your loved ones for an occasion to remember. Outdoors, lush landscaping and valley vistas set a backdrop for unforgettable gathering. A natural amphitheater and outdoor-tented area can host up to 400 guests, while indoors a classic ballroom is wrapped in windows for daylit gatherings or enchanting evening affairs.</p>

      <p class="small-paragraph">The property also features a Pete Dye designed 18-hole Full Cry golf course, which has been rated one of Golfweek Magazine’s “Top 200 Resort Courses in the U.S.” and “Best Courses You Can Play” in Virginia. Breathtaking views, environmentally friendly practices, and strategically designed holes for novice and expert-level golfers alike make this the perfect day out.</p>

      <p class="small-paragraph">Keswick Hall offers a world-class tennis experience to our guests, with 7 European Red Clay courts, a state-of-the-art LED lighting system will make it seem like daytime after the sun goes down, and high-quality tennis instruction.</p>

      <p class="small-paragraph">Take in the sweeping views of the Virginia countryside from our infinity Horizon Pool. Spend lavish days lounging poolside in one of our private cabanas.</p>
