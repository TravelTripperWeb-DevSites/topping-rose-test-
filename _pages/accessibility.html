    <p class="h3">Digital Accessibility Compliance Guidelines and Goals</p>

    <p>We strive to offer an excellent user experience for visitors using any type of assistive technology to access the website.

In addition, we actively work to maintain, assess and improve the usability and accessibility of our website through engagement of experts and regular testing of our digital accessibility.</p>
