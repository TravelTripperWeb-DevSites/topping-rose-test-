When planning the grounds at Keswick Hall, great care was taken in selecting plants and florals with consideration of form, texture, bloom and fragrance, as well as species that attract pollinators and birds. We hope that during your stay you will wander the grounds and enjoy the experience of each season.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
