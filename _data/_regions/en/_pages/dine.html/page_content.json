    "content": "<p>The cuisine at Marigold by Jean-Georges reflects a passionate commitment to fresh, local and organic ingredients. The menu changes often to offer sustainable and seasonal produce that is at its peak &ndash; much of it grown at our own nearby farm. Meat, fish and dairy are locally sourced, where possible, from humanely treated, pasture-fed animals free of antibiotics and hormones.</p>\n<p>The restaurant features 130 indoor seats, 20 bar seats and 70 outdoor seats. The design is a comfortable textural &ldquo;rustic chic&rdquo; with a mix of black and white stone and rustic hardwood floors, a distinctive bar with a fluted tile design, a stone fireplace and exquisite hand-wrought lighting fixtures from L&rsquo;Observatoire International.</p>",
