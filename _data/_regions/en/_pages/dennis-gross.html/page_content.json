Dr. Dennis Gross Dermatology offers a variety of chemical face peels. Chemical peels safely remove or exfoliate the top layer of dead skin allowing new, more youthful, healthy skin to show through. While the skin typically sheds old, dull dead skin cells every 28 days, this process slows down with prolonged sun exposure and aging. Chemical peels cause this natural cell turnover process to speed up, helping to stimulate the growth of new collagen, or the skin-firming protein that acts like a scaffold for the skin.</p>\n<p><strong>Topping Rose Skin Perfecting Facial</strong><br />Clean beauty starts here with this organic herb and flower facial designed to detoxify and tone the skin. Performing as a natural, safe alternative to microdermabrasion, this pore minimizing, skin refining treatment combines modern esthetic techniques with nutrient rich organic hydration to tighten and brighten the complexion for a polished, radiant glow.</p>\n<p><strong>60 minutes at $200* / 75 minutes at $225* / 90 minutes at $250*++<br /></strong><br /><strong>Customized Facial</strong><br />Tailored to your skin type, we offer 60, 75, and 90-minute facials that will leave you glowingly refreshed and renewed!+</p>\n<p><strong>60 minutes at $ 200* / 75 minutes at $225* / 90 minutes at $ 250*+<br /></strong><br />*Prices include tax &amp; gratuity</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a class=\"primary-cta mb-3\" href=\"mailto:lauren@dennisgrossmd.com, elena@dennisgrossmd.com?subject=TOPPING ROSE HOUSE BOOKING\">Book Now</a><br /> <a href=\"mailto:lauren@dennisgrossmd.com\">lauren@dennisgrossmd.com</a><br /> <a href=\"tel:646-736-1873\">646-736-1873</a></p>",
