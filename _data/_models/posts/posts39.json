    "en": "<p><strong>Always considered a top reason to visit the city during the holidays, this year&rsquo;s Christmas Spectacular in NYC promises to be the can&rsquo;t miss festive event of the season!</strong></p>\n<p>Have you only ever witnessed the perfectly in-sync, high kicks of these iconic dancers during the television broadcast of the <a href=\"https://www.macys.com/social/parade/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Macy&rsquo;s Thanksgiving Day Parade</a>? This is how many of us become captivated, but it&rsquo;s only a glimmer of the magic that is performed four times a day at <a href=\"https://www.rockettes.com/christmas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Radio City Music Hall</a> each winter. Starting on Friday, November 9, 2018 and running through Tuesday, January 1, 2019, the Rockettes will take the stage in the all-new Christmas Spectacular in NYC!</p>\n<p><strong>A Time-Honored Tradition Meets the 21st Century!</strong></p>\n<p>It may be hard to believe but these dancers, so long synonymous with NYC, got their start in St. Louis, Missouri. The Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall started in 1932, and a year after their arrival, the 30-minute Christmas Spectacular was born! Fast-forward through the decades, and this show now truly lives up to its &ldquo;spectacular&rdquo; name &ndash; over 90 minutes full of holiday-themed dance numbers and theatrical elements that pay homage to the old but with an eye on the future.<br /><br />Favorite features such as the Parade of the Wooden Soldiers and the Living Nativity remain. Yet new for 2018, technology meets tradition as they introduce a brand-new finale that will transform the entire Hall into a &ldquo;groundbreaking magical holiday light-show&rdquo;. Over 100 drones will take flight and promise to leave audiences, young and old, entranced by this wonderfully new \"Christmas Light&rdquo;!</p>\n<p><strong>Add your own personal memory to this NYC holiday tradition</strong></p>\n<p>Planning on spending the most wonderful time of the year in New York? Then why not start by booking a suite with us, here at The Manhattan Club. Only three blocks from Radio City Music Hall, as well as being near everything in the city that makes the holidays so bright, our comfortable accommodations are the perfect home base for all of your NYC holiday explorations.</p>"
