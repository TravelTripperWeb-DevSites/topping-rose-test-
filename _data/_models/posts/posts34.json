    "en": "<p><strong>Two ways &ndash; with &ldquo;practice&rdquo; or by walking across the street from The Manhattan Club</strong></p>\n<p>New York City has long been lauded as the place that if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere! For any musician, no matter their genre or personal style, this dream takes the form of finally being able to perform on stage at one of the most iconic buildings in New York: Carnegie Hall.</p>\n<p>Since 1981, when famed composer Tchaikovsky commanded the baton as he conducted his orchestra on opening night, legendary musicians and young dreamers alike have graced the stage to make their own musical magic. It is estimated that close to 50,000 performances have taken place throughout the years and the Hall shows no signs of stopping.</p>\n<p><strong>Why has Carnegie Hall stood the test of time?</strong></p>\n<p>In the ever-changing metropolis that is New York City, how does a concert hall from the turn of the last century continue to thrive? Maybe it&rsquo;s that the three stages that make up the complex are known to have some of the best acoustics across the globe. Or maybe it is the iconic status, having hosted almost every conceivable world-renowned artist from Pavarotti to The Beatles. There is no singular reason for its everlasting nature, but its continued dominance of the global music scene will always have its events near the top of the list of things to do in NYC!</p>\n<p><strong>Celebrate this grand history with The Manhattan Club!</strong></p>\n<p>The 2018-2019 Season at Carnegie Hall is about to begin (with Opening Night taking place on Wednesday, October 3, 2018). From the long-time subscribers to those ready to attend their first event, let The Manhattan Club help make your musical journey just as legendary as this American cultural touchstone. Right across the street from this beloved building, the comfort of our luxurious suites will provide you with the perfect standing ovation-worthy encore!</p>"
