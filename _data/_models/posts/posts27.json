Say goodbye to gridlock and honking horns, and hello to the <a title=\"Summer Streets in NYC\" href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/summerstreets/html/home/home.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Summer Streets in NYC</a>.</p>\n<p>During one of the best free events in NYC all summer, more than 75 blocks of Manhattan &ndash; from the Brooklyn Bridge to 72nd Street along Park and Lafayette &ndash; are closed to traffic. The seven-mile asphalt route will still be laden with thousands of travelers, only this time they will be running, walking, and biking through our beautiful city. Held between 7:00AM to 1:00PM, this trio of six-hour events, sponsored by the Department of Transportation to encourage more sustainable forms of transportation, also celebrates the benefits of a healthy lifestyle with the main emphasis being on fun.</p>\n<p>Inspired by similar global events, the iconic Manhattan architecture creates a unique backdrop that is like no other. Along with spectacular views, there are also activities along the way - from the customary rock climbing walls and zip lines, to walking tours and art installations, this annual celebration of the streets of New York is a can&rsquo;t-miss, free summer event. Last year&rsquo;s incarnation saw a 270-foot water slide added into the mix. We're hoping it will return, but we'll just have to wait until August 4, 11, and 18 to find out.</p>\n<p>Yet don&rsquo;t wait to plan your perfect Summer Streets getaway at The Manhattan Club - the luxury of our comfortable suites will be sure to provide you with the perfect haven for your pre- and post- pedestrian adventures.</p>"
