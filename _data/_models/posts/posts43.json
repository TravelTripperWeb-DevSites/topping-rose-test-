Are you?</strong></p>\n<p>Planning to visit New York City for <a title=\"Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade?\" href=\"https://www.macys.com/social/parade/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade?</a> The Manhattan Club has put together a quick last-minute guide on how to get the most out of this beloved NYC holiday tradition!</p>\n<p><strong>Before the big day (TODAY &ndash; Wednesday, November 21)</strong></p>\n<p><a title=\"Watch the balloon inflation.\" href=\"https://mommypoppins.com/new-york-city-kids/fall-activities/see-the-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-%20balloon-inflation-with-kids\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Watch the balloon inflation.</a></p>\n<p>Before Charlie Brown and the Red Power Ranger take to the air, they need to be inflated. From 1:00pm &ndash; 8:00pm on the streets around the American Museum of Nation History, all of the larger-than-life balloons will be blown up to their gargantuan final size! It's truly a sight to behold!</p>\n<p><a title=\"Decide on your viewing spot.\" href=\"https://www.amny.com/news/thanksgiving-parade-best-places-to-watch-along-the-route-1.12656268\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Decide on your viewing spot.</a></p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t wait until Thanksgiving morning to pick your viewing destination. With around 3.5 million spectators expected, you best be prepared with a few choices. Columbus Circle is ideal for those who don&rsquo;t want to do the most planning as there are many spaces available. For the early birds, we&rsquo;d suggest scoping out Central Park West.</p>\n<p><strong>IT&rsquo;S PARADE DAY! (Thursday, November 22)</strong></p>\n<p>Get to your spot&hellip; early. Even if the parade starts at 9:00am, many are out claiming their spots before the sun comes up. If you are traveling into the city, consider the holiday traffic. (Or maybe next year, decide to stay with us at The Manhattan Club to avoid the inevitable delays).</p>\n<p><strong>Be prepared and have a wonderful time!</strong></p>\n<p>It's going to be extra cold over the next couple of days, so be prepared for the cold weather that is heading our way, with lots of cozy layers, hats and gloves. After the last balloon has passed you by, be safe when traveling to your Thanksgiving festivities. Many of those 3.5 million other parade attendees are also trying to get &ldquo;out of town&rdquo;. The worst traveling time is said to be around 1:00pm, so consider catching a quick bite to eat, or spend some more time walking around and enjoying the magical sights of NYC!</p>\n<p>Wishing you all a very Happy Thanksgiving!</p>"
