From the standard department stores to the ever-present holiday markets in NYC, The Manhattan Club has compiled a list of four can&rsquo;t-miss spots to enjoy the sights and sounds of the season while checking off the names on your list!</p>\n<p><strong>Bryant Park Holiday Market</strong><br />We&rsquo;ve already spotlighted this homage to the traditional European open-air markets of yore, yet The Holiday Shops at Bryant Park should be on every shopper&rsquo;s list of can&rsquo;t-miss gift giving destinations. Over 100 vendors line aisles of festive outdoor stalls and offer a wide variety of gifts from artisan crafts to designer goods and delicious homemade treats.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Macy&rsquo;s \" href=\"https://www.macys.com/\"><strong>Macy&rsquo;s</strong></a></p>\n<p>A true landmark of our city and known for its festive spirit worldwide (from the spectacular Thanksgiving Day Parade to the film &ldquo;Miracle on 34th Street&rdquo;), this retail giant still brings the holiday cheer. Taking up an entire city block, this destination is also famous for its beautifully festive window displays.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Dylan&rsquo;s Candy Bar\" href=\"https://www.dylanscandybar.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Dylan&rsquo;s Candy Bar</strong></a></p>\n<p>Kids and those young-at-heart won&rsquo;t want to miss this three-story shop of all things candy. A great place to fill up those stockings, you&rsquo;ll find sugary delights from every era!</p>\n<p><strong><a title=\"FAO Schwarz\" href=\"https://faoschwarz.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FAO Schwarz</a></strong></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Return to Wonder&rdquo; as this NYC landmark returns home after closing its doors in 2015. In a new location at 30 Rock, all of your favorite, larger-than-life, features (such as that giant piano) will return to this Wonderful World of Toys (opening November 16th).</p>\n<p>Shopping at any time in The City That Never Sleeps is a fun-filled yet hectic activity. For the holiday season, ensure you have a place to wind down and relax after all of the action when you book a suite with us at The Manhattan Club.</p>"
