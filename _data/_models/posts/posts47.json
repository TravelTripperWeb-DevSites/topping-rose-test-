    "en": "<p><strong>It&rsquo;s not just a fancy French word &ndash; discover the high standard of personalized customer service that can only come from the best concierge in New York!</strong></p>\n<p>Our accommodations may be comfortably luxurious and amenities plentiful, but at the heart of The Manhattan Club is a dedicated team of genuine staff members. From the hardworking housekeepers to the warm and welcoming reception staff, every member is held to the highest standard of service. Yet to truly make unique and personal Manhattan memories, there are no more important members of our team than the best concierge in New York!</p>\n<p><strong>What is a &ldquo;concierge&rdquo;?</strong></p>\n<p>The direct translation from the French language &ndash; &ldquo;keeper of the keys&rdquo; &ndash; no longer applies to these vanguards of service. In the Middle Ages, a concierge kept the keys at the royal residences and ensured that visiting guests had everything they required. Today, our concierge staff exceeds this Old World designation with the highest standard of personalized care. In a City That Never Sleeps, this can take on many forms throughout the day, but the focus always remains on accommodating our guests every request for the betterment of their Manhattan Club experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Tips from The Best Concierge Staff in NYC!</strong></p>\n<p>Our team is available daily to help wherever needed&nbsp;and to make sure your visit with us is a truly memorable experience. From making reservations to nearby restaurants, arranging transportation services, or even helping you secure tickets to events in the area, no request is too implausible. Yet here are some tips on how to get the most out of their amazing services.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only car services can be booked in advance. While they can give you tips and maybe even physically assist, by law, cabs can only be hailed from the street.</li>\n<li>The busiest restaurant times vary depending on the area of the city. 7:00pm-9:00pm is standard &ldquo;prime time&rdquo;. For the Theatre District, this is pushed earlier (5:00pm-7:00pm) and Downtown tends to be later (8:00pm-10:00pm) to cater to the vibrant nightlife.</li>\n<li>The more time you give them to work their magic, the better. Requests can be made even prior to your arrival by contacting them at concierges@tmcny.com.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We look forward to serving you soon!</p>"
