While always a time of reflecting on the many things in our lives to be thankful for, this November holiday has many traditions that have become celebrated over time. Turkey dinners, football games, preparing for Black Friday shopping &ndash; all customary events that will take place across the Red, White, and Blue! Yet, if you&rsquo;re looking to start a new tradition this year, The Manhattan Club has three unique and fabulous events to help you celebrate your Thanksgiving in New York City!</p>\n<p><strong><a title=\"Macy&rsquo;s Thanksgiving Day Parade\" href=\"https://www.macys.com/social/parade/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Macy&rsquo;s Thanksgiving Day Parade</a></strong></p>\n<p>Whether you take in the pre-flight Balloon Inflation, or wish to see the finished product make its way down 34th Street, the magic that started 93 years ago will surely leave you spellbound. One warning &ndash; watching from home will never be the same again!</p>\n<p><strong><a title=\"The Radio City Rockettes\" href=\"https://www.rockettes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Radio City Rockettes</a></strong></p>\n<p>Kick off the holiday season on the proper foot by swinging by Radio City Music Hall to see the legendary Rockettes perform their Christmas Spectacular.</p>\n<p><strong><a title=\"Prospect Park Turkey Trot\" href=\"https://pptc.org/turkey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Prospect Park Turkey Trot</a></strong></p>\n<p>Always a fun way to start off the day, the annual 5K run through the fall foliage of Prospect Park is actually early on Thanksgiving morning - a wonderful way to bring everyone together for a joyful celebration of the season, a healthy start to a delicious food-filled day, and a great gathering of the community. <br /><br /> Thanksgiving is also a great time to experience all of the everyday wonders of visiting NYC. Have your Thanksgiving meal at a classic restaurant, take in the holiday window displays as you get in some early gift shopping, or just visit a few of the iconic sites that we are thankful to have as part of our Never Sleeping city. Another holiday tradition to start: stay with us at The Manhattan Club. A truly classic NYC hotel, our luxurious suite accommodations we will make sure that you still feel right at home while making new traditions in the Empire State.</p>"
