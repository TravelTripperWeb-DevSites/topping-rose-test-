    "en": "<p><strong>The sweet sounds of summer in New York City have arrived with the 33rd anniversary of SummerStage!</strong></p>\n<p>Since the 1980&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s been one iconic music festival that has highlighted summer in New York City. And when we say New York City, we mean <strong>all five boroughs,</strong> as <a href=\"https://cityparksfoundation.org/summerstage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SummerStage</a> includes events that occur almost every day and cannot be contained to one city park. No matter your preferred genre, you&rsquo;ll be sure to discover that one of these mostly free concerts in NYC has the music that speaks to your soul.</p>\n<p>Running this year from June 2nd to September 27th, there will be over one hundred shows with the main-stage being at the iconic Rumsey Playfield in Central Park. There's so many, that just reading through the <a href=\"https://cityparksfoundation.org/calendar/category/summerstage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SummerStage schedule&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;is a fun event in and of itself.</p>\n<p>Some of the more high-profile events, including <a href=\"https://www.jasonmraz.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jason Mraz</a> (August 9) and <a href=\"https://www.mac-demarco.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mac DeMarco </a>(September 8), require tickets, but most of the concerts are free. It is truly a highlight of the summer, and many of us feel that the line-up gives us some of the best free concerts in NYC for the entire year. Along with the amazing tunes, there will be lots of local food vendors, so be sure to show up early, get a prime spot in the park, and get ready for some great summer music.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you're plans include getting lost in the beauty of the <a href=\"https://www.linesballet.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alonzo King LINES Ballet </a>(July 25th) or being inspired by the new generation of social justice warriors in VOICES of a People&rsquo;s History (August 28th), then book a room with us at The Manhattan Club. Only a quick walk away from all of the wonderful events, we're the perfect home base for enjoying this perennial NYC summer highlight!</p>"
