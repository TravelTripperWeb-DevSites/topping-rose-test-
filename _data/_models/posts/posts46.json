    "en": "<p>If you're planning to celebrate New Year&rsquo;s Eve in New York City, specifically in the heart of all the action in Times Square, countdown with our ten tips to ensure your night is a fabulous one to remember!</p>\n<p><strong>10. No tickets needed.&nbsp;</strong>The annual New Year&rsquo;s Eve celebration in Times Square is a free event (there are no public viewing spaces for sale). Only businesses in the area (such as restaurants and hotels) may be selling tickets for private viewing parties.<br /><br /><strong>9. Arrive early.</strong> With no tickets, the event is truly a first-come, first serve affair. If you show up too early, before the barriers are set, you may have to move, so check the<a href=\"https://www.timessquarenyc.org/times-square-new-years-eve/nye-live-schedule\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&nbsp;Times Square Official Schedule</a> and <a href=\"https://www.timessquarenyc.org/times-square-new-years-eve/nye-faq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FAQ</a> for the&nbsp;&ldquo;opening&rdquo; time and any other questions that you may have. Plan on showing up in the morning or early afternoon (3:00pm starts the &ldquo;mad rush&rdquo;).<br /><br /><strong>8. Come well-fed and pack plenty of snacks.</strong>&nbsp;The classic NYC food vendors are not allowed inside the designated area.<br /><br /><strong>7. Dress in layers.</strong>&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll be standing for hours outside. No matter what the weather forecast is, the best bet is always casual, comfortable layers.<br /><br /><strong>6. There's no midnight &ldquo;champagne&rdquo; toast in Times Square. </strong>Public drinking is illegal in NYC.<br /><br /><strong>5. Take the minimum. </strong>Security is always high for New Year's Eve in Times Square, and only small bags are permitted, so try to leave any bags and extras at home.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>4. Use public transportation if you can. </strong>With the amount of revelers celebrating New Year&rsquo;s Eve in NYC, forget the car (and even cabs will be in short supply) so subways will be your best mode of transportation.<br /><br /><strong>3. There are no public restrooms, so plan accordingly.</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>2. See the ascent as well as the famous descent</strong>! At approximately 6:00pm, the excitement starts to build as the gigantic crystal globe slowly makes its way to the very top of the pole.<br /><br /><strong>1. Book a room at The Manhattan Club.&nbsp;</strong>Make your New Year&rsquo;s Eve in NYC one to truly remember by staying in the comfort of our&nbsp;luxurious suite accommodations, located only 9 blocks away from the biggest party of the year!</p>"
