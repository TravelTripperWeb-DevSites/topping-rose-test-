    "en": "<p><strong>Calling all foodies and wine lovers: the 2018 NYC Wine and Food Festival is right around the corner!</strong></p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever attended a Food and Wine Festival, you know what to expect - a variety of different tastings, some interesting hands-on demonstrations, and a chance to mingle with like-minded foodies from all around the area. Picture that scene, but to &ldquo;the nth degree&rdquo;, and you have the always wonderful <a title=\"NYC Wine and Food Festival\" href=\"https://nycwff.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NYC Wine and Food Festival</a>.<br /><br />Taking place this year from Thursday, October 11 through Sunday, October 14, not only does this four-day event bring together a smorgasbord of the top international culinary talents to a variety of venues throughout the city, but all of the proceeds go toward the No Kid Hungry campaign and Food Bank for New York City in an attempt to eradicate hunger in the local area.<br /><br />With more than 80 events spanning the city, you can expect to find something for every palate and any budget. Intimate dinners at participating restaurants, cooking classes to tempt your creativity, or a fun, casual large-scale room tasting &ndash; the choices are endless. <br /><br />Some of your top picks will be sure to feature some of the renowned celebrity chefs in NYC. Want something for the whole family? Duff Goldman of Charm City Cakes and the reality-show &ldquo;Ace of Cakes&rdquo; will be hosting his own Family Ice Cream Fun-dae. Looking for something for the 21 and over crowd? Then, you won&rsquo;t want to miss the Tacos &amp; Tequila event hosted by Aaron Sanchez of &ldquo;Chopped&rdquo; fame.<br /><br />With over 500 world-renowned culinary personalities on hand, be sure to take a look at the <a title=\"New York City Wine &amp; Food Festival calendar\" href=\"https://nycwff.org/events/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New York City Wine &amp; Food Festival calendar</a>&nbsp;to find the perfect event for you. They even have event packages which will give you a tremendous variety to choose from, making sure you don&rsquo;t miss out on your favorite culinary experience (and perhaps stretching your NYCWFF budget even further).<br /><br />This event is just one of the reasons that we love being right in the middle of New York City! Everything is within reach, and there&rsquo;s always something new happening. It's very much anticipated here at The Manhattan Club and we hope you're also planning to visit and enjoy this incomparable New York City celebration of food!</p>"
