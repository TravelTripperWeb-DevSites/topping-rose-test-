One of the best ways to do it is going to a Memorial Day Parade. New York City has many options to choose from: the biggest parade is <a href=\"https://www.lndmemorialday.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Little Neck-Douglaston parade</a> in Queens, but if you&rsquo;re not up for the trek there, head instead to Riverside Park for the <a href=\"https://www.ourveterans.nyc/soldiers_and_sailors_memorial_day_observance_20190527\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Soldiers&rsquo; and Sailors&rsquo; Memorial Day Observance</a> from 10am‒12pm.</p>\n<h3><strong><a href=\"http://militarynews.com/app/fleetweeknewyork/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fleet Week</a></strong></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Every year, members of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps gather in New York.

The 2019 season kicks off on May 21, 2019 with Shakespeare&rsquo;s Much Ado About Nothing directed by Tony Award winner Kenny Leon.
