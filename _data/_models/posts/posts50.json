The spanking new corner of New York is called <a href=\"https://www.hudsonyardsnewyork.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hudson Yards</a>. Here&rsquo;s everything you need to know about this waterfront neighborhood before you venture out to explore it.</p>\n<h3><strong>Hudson Yards in a Nutshell</strong></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Located between 10th and 12th Avenues from West 30th to West 34th Street, Hudson Yards, like Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen and Chelsea, went from a forgotten industrial patch of land to a sleek and chic space coveted by the city&rsquo;s major brands. You&rsquo;ll find culinary masterpieces, world-renowned brands, public parks and art exhibitions spanning over 14 acres!</p>\n<h3><strong><a href=\"https://www.hudsonyardsnewyork.com/discover\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Main Attractions</a></strong></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Don&rsquo;t make the mistake of thinking about Hudson Yards as just another fancy mall, though. It&rsquo;s central structure is the Vessel, a spiral staircase with 154 flights of stairs and 80 landings. This futuristic landmark overlooks the Hudson River and offers stunning views of the city. In fact, the Vessel is by far the most photographed area of Hudson Yards. To visit it, you need to book free tickets in advance or snag a few same-day tickets.</p>\n<p>If you want more skyline views, climb to the Edge, &ldquo;the highest man-made outdoor viewing area in the western hemisphere.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s something worth seeing!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Art buffs should head straight to Snark Park and The Shed.
