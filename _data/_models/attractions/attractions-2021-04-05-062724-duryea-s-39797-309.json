It was still a great view. I had the peel yourself shrimp and tuna (steak) sandwich which were both great. When ordering at the window you pay and tip. They encouraged me to tip 20% stating I would have a full server at my table but did not have one once. Afterwards I looked at my tab and noticed a water charge and did not receive water. I asked for a bottle to go but turns out the $4 charge was for tap water refilled in a glass bottle. I felt deceived. I will go back but will know better than to tip 20% on a self service table.",

I will be surprised if this place will be open for long. Their was about thirty people they turned away because they closed for table service. Let me know when you are selling the restaurant.
