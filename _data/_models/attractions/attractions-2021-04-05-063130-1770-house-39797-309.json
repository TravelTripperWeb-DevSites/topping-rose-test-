After speaking with Randye, the 1770 House was the only place we considered given her extremely helpful and kind responses. However, the overall experience left room for disappoinment. We were not treated as if we were on our honeymoon at all. I even asked for a welcome glass of champagne and I was told \"We'll see how you feel when you arrive.\" The room was pretty, but there was no tub and the TV only had minimal channels with no ability to hookup to streaming TV. Our first night we ate at the hotel restaurant and the food was phenomenal. There was some confusion about the housecleaning. The room was not cleaned for two days - the second day the \"Service Please\" sign was hanging. Nonetheless, when we went to check out, I was still charged for housekeeping. If you're looking for a nice place to stay this is it - but if you're looking for someplace amazing, I would keep looking.",
